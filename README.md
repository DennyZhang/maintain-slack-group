## Principle

### Make friends with all active users

### Don't make people feel forced to do anything. It should come from themselves.

### It's all about the audience.

### You should enjoy and learn from all the conversations.

### Ask people to take actions, but only the mininum actions

## Lessons learned

### Setup right expectation for each activity

### Only include people into discussion which he/she personally is interested.

### Get more attention first; Pouring too much information is bad and useless.

### Don't get discussion distracted. Timing is important.

## Routine tasks

### Collect and share interested and related stuff

### As maintainers, keep asking yourself: what beneift people can get from the group today.

### Whenever a new memeber join, send him/her a warm welcome message

### Keep starting private 1-1 conversations.

## Doc Template

### Invite people into the slack group

    XXX, I have created a DevOps slack group recently. A private group. By invitation only.
    
    Would you like to join it?
    
    (It's totally fine if you choose to skip)
    
    https://yourfakechannel.slack.com/
    
    Super nice. Probably you will see some old friends there.
    
    Send me a private message, when you're in.

### Invite people to #blog-review

    XX, we have a private channel: #blog-review.
    
    It's for IT bloggers. We give review for each other, before publishing them to public.
    
    Do you want to join?
    
    And it's perfectly fine, if you skip this.
