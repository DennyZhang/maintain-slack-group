--------------------------------------------------------
** Principle
*** Make friends with all active users
*** Don't make people feel forced to do anything. It should come from themselves.
*** It's all about the audience.
*** You should enjoy and learn from all the conversations.
*** Ask people to take actions, but only the mininum actions
** Lessons learned
*** Setup right expectation for each activity
*** Only include people into discussion which he/she personally is interested.
*** Get more attention first; Pouring too much information is bad and useless.
*** Don't get discussion distracted. Timing is important.
** Routine tasks
*** Collect and share interested and related stuff
*** As maintainers, keep asking yourself: what beneift people can get from the group today.
*** Whenever a new memeber join, send him/her a warm welcome message
*** Keep starting private 1-1 conversations.
** Doc Template
*** Invite people into the slack group

Send me a private message, when you're in.
