** Slack Introduction
- Youtube: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsX8V4hzENo][Messaging in Slack]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvJAcElFMUU][15 Slack tips in 5 minutes]]
** Principle
- Value Stream Of Your group Ask yourself
What values each of your message bring to the audience. The world is already very nosiy. Bring values, instead of wasting people's time.

- Make friends with all active users
- Don't make people feel forced to do anything. It should come from themselves.
- It's all about the audience.
- You should enjoy and learn from all the conversations.
- Ask people to take actions, but only the mininum actions
** Lessons learned
- Setup right expectation for each activity
- Only include people into discussion which he/she personally is interested.
- Get more attention first; Pouring too much information is bad and useless.
- Don't get discussion distracted. Timing is important.
** Routine tasks
*** Old Friends
- Every morning takes 10 minutes: Say hi to whoever online in your slack group.
- Keep starting private 1-1 conversations.
*** Content
- Collect and share interested and related stuff
*** New Friends
- Whenever a new memeber join, send him/her a warm welcome message
*** Value Stream
- Ask people to add linkedin endorsement or recommendations for mentors in your group
** Doc Template
*** doc: Invite people into the slack group
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
XXX, I have created a DevOps slack group recently. A private group. By invitation only.

Would you like to join it?

(It's totally fine if you choose to skip)

Send me a private message, when you're there. (My id is @dennyzhang)

Probably you will see some old friends in that group.

Slack helps to keep me closer to my friends, compared to LinkedIn.

Last time I "wasted" 5 minutes to find one old conversation in LinkedIn.

XX, we have a channel: #blog-review.

It's for IT bloggers. We give review for each other, before publishing them to public.

Do you want to join?

And it's perfectly fine, if you skip this.
