--------------------------------------------------------
** Principle
*** Ask yourself: What values each of your message bring to the audience
The world is already very nosiy. Bring values, instead of wasting people's time.
*** Make friends with all active users
*** Don't make people feel forced to do anything. It should come from themselves.
*** It's all about the audience.
*** You should enjoy and learn from all the conversations.
*** Ask people to take actions, but only the mininum actions
** Lessons learned
*** Setup right expectation for each activity
*** Only include people into discussion which he/she personally is interested.
*** Get more attention first; Pouring too much information is bad and useless.
*** Don't get discussion distracted. Timing is important.
** Routine tasks
*** Every morning takes 10 minutes: Say hi to whoever online in your slack group.
*** Collect and share interested and related stuff
*** As maintainers, keep asking yourself: what beneift people can get from the group today.
*** Whenever a new memeber join, send him/her a warm welcome message
*** Ask people to add linkedin endorsement or recommendations for mentors in your group
*** Keep starting private 1-1 conversations.
** Doc Template
*** doc: Invite people into the slack group

Send me a private message, when you're there.

Probably you will see some old friends there.

Slack helps to keep me closer to my friends, compared to LinkedIn.

Last time I "wasted" 5 minutes to find one old conversation in LinkedIn.
